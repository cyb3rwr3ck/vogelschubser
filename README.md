# vogelschubser
vogelschubser is a way to initialize a anonymous command-and-control connection to a Linux based server using commands send to twitter. The script uses TOR, timing offsets and changing user-agents to obscure its connections to twitter.
It does not utilize the twitter API and thus no API keys are needed. 

### Usage
* get your anonymous twitter account. They allow TOR and will be happy to give you a call in your hotel room or on your burner phone for verfification.
* configure settings.cfg with the needed informations 
* configure something (e.g. cron, crontab, whatever...) to run the script every N minutes

You will need to get your twitter_auth token and to setup TOR with its controll port waiting for password based authentication.
